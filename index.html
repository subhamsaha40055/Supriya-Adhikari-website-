            <h2>About <strong>Me</strong></h2>
            <p>
                I am <strong>Supriya Adhikary</strong>, a dedicated guest lecturer and educator with a passion for teaching and a deep expertise in the fields of education and Sanskrit. My academic journey has been shaped by years of study and experience, and I continuously seek innovative methods to bridge traditional knowledge with modern educational practices. Through thorough research and a student-centric approach, I strive to make the beauty and richness of Sanskrit accessible to today's learners.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the classroom, my priority is to create an engaging and effective learning environment, where students not only learn but also develop a true appreciation for the subject. Outside of teaching, I am actively involved in research and frequently participate in academic conferences, sharing my work and learning from others in my field. These experiences allow me to stay at the forefront of academic advancements and to bring fresh perspectives into my teaching.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                My commitment to education is grounded in a desire to preserve cultural heritage while fostering academic excellence. I see my role not just as an educator, but as a guide and mentor to the next generation of scholars. It is my hope to inspire and support students as they embark on their own academic journeys, helping them realize their full potential.
